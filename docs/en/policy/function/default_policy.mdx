# Default Policies in Alauda Container Security

Alauda Container Security offers a set of default policies to help you prevent high-risk deployments and respond to runtime incidents in your Kubernetes environment. These policies are designed to identify security issues and enforce best practices across your clusters.

> **Note:**
> Policy severity levels in Alauda Container Security: **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**. These differ from Red Hat Product Security levels: **Critical**, **Important**, **Moderate**, **Low**. See [Severity Ratings](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification) for details.

## Overview

Default policies cover the entire container lifecycle: build, deploy, and runtime. You can view, clone, and edit these policies in the Alauda Container Security portal. **Default policies cannot be deleted or directly modified.**

### Viewing Policies

1. Go to **Platform Configuration** > **Policy Management** in the portal.
2. The **Policies** view lists all default and custom policies, including their status, severity, and lifecycle stage.

## Policy Table Structure

- **Policy**: Policy name
- **Description**: What the policy detects or enforces
- **Status**: **Enabled** or **Disabled**
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Lifecycle**: Build, Deploy, or Runtime
