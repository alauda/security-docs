# Use Policy to Verify Image Signature

Alauda Container Security allows you to ensure the integrity of container images in your clusters by verifying image signatures against pre-configured keys. You can create policies to block unsigned images or images without a verified signature, and enforce these policies using the admission controller to prevent unauthorized deployments.

## Supported Signature Verification Methods

Alauda Container Security supports the following signature verification methods:

- Cosign public keys
- Cosign certificates

> **Note:**
> - Only Cosign signatures and Cosign Public Keys/Certificates verification are supported. For more information, see [Cosign overview](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview).
> - Communication with the transparency log [Rekor](https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/) is not supported.
> - At least one Cosign verification method must be configured for signature verification.
> - For all deployed and watched images:
>   - Signatures are fetched and verified every 4 hours.
>   - Signatures are verified whenever you update signature integration verification data.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a PEM-encoded Cosign public key or the required certificate identity and issuer. For more details, see [Cosign overview](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview) and [Cosign certificate verification](https://docs.sigstore.dev/verifying/verify/#verify-image-with-user-provided-trusted-chain).

## Configure Signature Integration

### Using Cosign Public Keys

1. In the Alauda Container Security portal, go to **Platform Configuration** > **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to **Signature Integrations** and click **Signature**.
3. Click **New integration**.
4. Enter a name for the integration.
5. Click **Cosign public Keys** and then **Add a new public key**.
6. Enter the public key name and the PEM-encoded public key value.
7. (Optional) Add more public keys as needed.
8. Click **Save**.

### Using Cosign Certificates

1. In the Alauda Container Security portal, go to **Platform Configuration** > **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to **Signature Integrations** and click **Signature**.
3. Click **New integration**.
4. Enter a name for the integration.
5. Click **Cosign certificates** and then **Add a new certificate verification**.
6. Enter the **Certificate OIDC Issuer** (regular expressions in [RE2 Syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) are supported).
7. Enter the **Certificate identity** (regular expressions in [RE2 Syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) are supported).
8. (Optional) Enter the **Certificate Chain PEM encoded** to verify certificates. If not provided, certificates are verified against the [Fulcio](https://docs.sigstore.dev/certificate_authority/overview/) root.
9. (Optional) Enter the **Certificate PEM encoded** to verify the signature.
10. (Optional) Add more certificate verifications as needed.
11. Click **Save**.

## Create and Enforce Image Signature Verification Policies

### Prerequisites

- At least one Cosign public key must be configured in a signature integration.

### Procedure

1. When creating or editing a policy, drag the **Not verified by trusted image signers** criteria into the policy field under **Policy criteria**.
2. Click **Select**.
3. Choose the trusted image signers from the list and click **Save**.

To prevent the use of unsigned images, enable the **Contact Image Scanners** feature in your cluster configuration. Then, when creating a security policy to enforce signature verification, select the **Inform and enforce** option.
