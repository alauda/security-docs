# Responding to Violations

Alauda Container Security helps you view, investigate, and address policy violations.

Its built-in policies detect vulnerabilities (CVEs), DevOps best practice violations, risky build/deploy actions, and suspicious runtime behaviors. Violations are reported when enabled policies are not met.

Understanding namespace conditions helps you manage which namespaces belong to the Alauda Container Platform, layered products, and third-party partners.

## Namespace Conditions for Platform Components

| Platform Component         | Namespace Condition                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alauda Container Platform | Namespace = `cpaas-system`, Namespace starts with `kube-`                                        |
| Layered Products          | Namespace = `stackrox`, Namespace starts with `acs-operator`, Namespace starts with `open-cluster-management`, Namespace = `multicluster-engine`, Namespace = `aap`, Namespace = `hive` |
| Third Party Partners      | Namespace = `nvidia-gpu-operator`                                                                    |

Alauda Container Security uses the following regex to identify platform workloads:

```
^kube-.*|^alauda-.*|^stackrox$|^acs-operator$|^open-cluster-management$|^multicluster-engine$|^aap$|^hive$|^nvidia-gpu-operator$|^cpaas-system$
```

This definition is not customizable. To see its effect:

1. Click **Search** in the portal.
2. Select **Show Orchestrator Components**.
3. Filter by `Platform Component: true`.

## Viewing Violations

1. In the portal, click **Violations**.
2. Tabs let you view violations by category:
   - **User Workloads**: User-managed workloads
   - **Platform**: Platform and layered services
   - **All Violations**: All, including audit log violations
3. Tabs let you view by type:
   - **Active**: Unresolved or in build/deploy
   - **Resolved**: Addressed or manually resolved
   - **Attempted**: Blocked by enforced policies
4. Sort, filter, and view details as needed.
5. To exclude deployments from a policy:
   - For one: use the overflow menu, select **Exclude deployment from policy**
   - For multiple: use **Row actions** > **Exclude deployments from policy**

## Violation Details

The **Violations** page shows:

- **Policy**: Violated policy name
- **Entity**: Where the violation occurred
- **Type**: Entity type (e.g., Deployment, Pod, DaemonSet, Secrets, ConfigMaps, ClusterRoles)
- **Enforced**: Whether enforcement was active
- **Severity**: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`
- **Categories**: Policy category
- **Lifecycle**: `Build`, `Deploy`, `Runtime`
- **Time**: When the violation occurred

Selecting a violation opens a details panel:

### Violation Tab

Shows how the policy was violated, including specific values or runtime process details.

### Deployment Tab

Shows deployment details:
- **Deployment ID/Name/Type**
- **Cluster/Namespace/Replicas**
- **Created/Updated** times
- **Labels/Annotations/Service Account**

#### Container Configuration
- **Image Name**
- **Resources**: CPU/Memory requests and limits
- **Volumes**
- **Secrets**: Name and container path
- **Volume Details**: Name, source, destination, type

#### Port Configuration
- **containerPort**
- **protocol**
- **exposure**
- **exposureInfo**: Internal/external, service name/ID, cluster IP, service port, node port, external IPs

#### Security Context
- **Privileged**: `true` or `false`

#### Network Policy
- Lists namespace and network policies; click a policy name to view YAML

## Policy Tab

Shows details of the policy that caused the violation.

### Policy Overview
- **Severity**
- **Categories**
- **Type**: User or system policy
- **Description**
- **Rationale**
- **Guidance**
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Related tactics/techniques

### Policy Behavior
- **Lifecycle Stage**: `Build`, `Deploy`, `Runtime`
- **Event Source** (for `Runtime`):
  - **Deployment**: Triggered by process/network activity, pod execution, or port forwarding
  - **Audit logs**: Triggered by matching audit log records
- **Response**:
  - **Inform**: Generates a violation
  - **Inform and enforce**: Enforced
- **Enforcement**:
  - **Build**: Fails CI builds for noncompliant images
  - **Deploy**: Blocks creation/update of noncompliant deployments if admission controller is enabled
  - **Runtime**: Deletes pods when events match policy criteria

### Policy Criteria
Alauda Container Security supports two deploy-time enforcement types:
- **Hard Enforcement**: Admission controller blocks creation or update of violating deployments
- **Soft Enforcement**: Sensor scales replicas to 0 for violating deployments

**Note:** By default, certain admin namespaces (e.g., `stackrox`, `kube-system`, `cpaas-system`, `istio-system`) are excluded from enforcement. Requests from service accounts in system namespaces are also bypassed.

For existing deployments, policy changes are enforced at the next relevant Kubernetes event. To reassess, go to **Policy Management** and click **Reassess All**.
