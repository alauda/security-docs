# Introduction

## What is a Policy Violation?

Alauda Container Security for Kubernetes allows you to view, investigate, and address policy violations in your clusters. You can quickly identify the root cause of a violation and take corrective actions to improve your security posture.

## How Violations Are Detected

Alauda Container Securityâ€™s built-in policies detect a wide range of security issues, including:
- Vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Violations of DevOps best practices
- High-risk build and deployment activities
- Suspicious runtime behaviors

You can use the default security policies or define your own custom policies. When an enabled policy is violated, Alauda Container Security reports it as a violation for your review and remediation.
