# Workload and Cluster Compliance Monitoring

Alauda Container Security enables you to perform compliance scans to assess the compliance status of your entire infrastructure. The compliance dashboard provides a centralized view, allowing you to filter data and monitor compliance across clusters, namespaces, and nodes.

## Overview

By generating detailed compliance reports and focusing on specific standards, controls, and industry benchmarks, you can track and share the compliance status of your environment, ensuring your infrastructure meets required standards.

A compliance scan creates a snapshot of your environment, including alerts, images, network policies, deployments, and host-based data. Data is collected from Sensors and compliance containers running in each Collector pod.

The compliance container gathers:
- Configurations for the container daemon, runtime, and images
- Container network information
- Command-line arguments and processes for the container runtime, Kubernetes, and Alauda Container Platform
- Permissions for specific file paths
- Configuration files for Kubernetes and Alauda Container Platform core services

After data collection, Alauda Container Security analyzes the results, which are available in the compliance dashboard and can be exported as reports.

## Key Concepts

- **Control**: A single requirement in an industry or regulatory standard. Alauda Container Security verifies compliance with a control by performing one or more checks.
- **Check**: A specific test performed during a control assessment. If any check fails, the control is marked as Fail.

## Running a Compliance Scan

1. In the Alauda Container Security portal, go to **Compliance Dashboard**.
2. (Optional) To filter by specific standards:
   - Click **Manage standards**.
   - Deselect any standards you do not want to display.
   - Click **Save**.
3. Click **Scan environment**.

:::info
Scanning the entire environment typically takes about 2 minutes, depending on the number of clusters and nodes.

## Viewing Compliance Results

### Compliance Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of compliance standards across all clusters, namespaces, and nodes, including charts and options to investigate issues.

- To view compliance status for all clusters: Go to **Compliance Dashboard** and select the **Clusters** tab.
- To view a specific cluster: In the **Passing standards by cluster** widget, click a cluster name.
- To view all namespaces: Go to **Compliance Dashboard** and select the **Namespaces** tab.
- To view a specific namespace: In the **Namespaces** table, click a namespace to open its details.

### By Standard

Alauda Container Security supports CIS , STIG compliance standards. To view controls for a specific standard:

1. Go to **Compliance Dashboard**.
2. In the **Passing standards across clusters** widget, click a standard to see all associated controls.

### By Control

To view the compliance status for a specific control:

1. Go to **Compliance Dashboard**.
2. In the **Passing standards by cluster** widget, click a standard.
3. In the **Controls** table, click a control to view its details.

### Filtering Compliance Data

You can filter compliance data by clusters, standards, or control status:

1. Go to **Compliance Dashboard**.
2. Select the **Clusters**, **Namespaces**, or **Nodes** tab.
3. Enter filtering criteria in the search bar and press **Enter**.

## Generating Compliance Reports

Alauda Container Security allows you to generate:
- **Executive reports**: Business-focused, with charts and summaries (PDF format)
- **Evidence reports**: Technical, with detailed information (CSV format)

To export reports:

1. Go to **Compliance Dashboard**.
2. Click the **Export** tab:
   - Select **Download Page as PDF** for executive reports
   - Select **Download Evidence as CSV** for evidence reports

:::info
The **Export** option is available on all compliance pages and filtered views.
