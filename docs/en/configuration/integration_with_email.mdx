# Integration with Email    

Alauda Container Security supports sending notifications via email. You can configure your existing email provider or use the built-in email notifier to send alerts. Notifications can be sent to a default recipient or dynamically determined using annotations in your deployment or namespace.

:::info 
Port `25` is blocked by default. Configure your mail server to use port `587` or `465` for sending email notifications.
:::

## Configuring Email Integration

Follow these steps to set up email notifications:

### Add a New Email Integration

1. Navigate to **Platform Configuration** > **Integrations**.
2. Under **Notifier Integrations**, select **Email**.
3. Click **New Integration**.
4. Enter a name for your integration in the **Integration name** field.
5. In the **Email server** field, provide the address of your email server, including the FQDN and port (e.g., `smtp.example.com:465`).
6. (Optional) To use unauthenticated SMTP, select **Enable unauthenticated SMTP**.  
   :::warning
   This is insecure and not recommended unless required for internal servers.
   :::
7. Enter the username and password for the service account used for authentication.
8. (Optional) Specify the display name for the `FROM` header in the **From** field (e.g., `Security Alerts`).
9. Enter the sender's email address in the **Sender** field.
10. Specify the default recipient's email address in the **Default recipient** field.

### Dynamic Recipient with Annotations (Optional)

You can use annotations to dynamically determine the recipient of email notifications:

1. In the **Annotation key for recipient** field, enter an annotation key (e.g., `email`).
2. Add an annotation to your deployment or namespace YAML file:

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      annotations:
        email: <recipient_email@example.com>
    ```

3. Alauda Container Security will send alerts to the email specified in the annotation. If no annotation is found, the alert is sent to the default recipient.

**Recipient Resolution Rules:**

- If a deployment has the annotation key, its value overrides the default recipient.
- If the namespace has the annotation key, its value overrides the default recipient.
- If neither exists, the default recipient is used.

### TLS and StartTLS Settings

- (Optional) To send email without TLS, select **Disable TLS certificate validation (insecure)**.  
  :::info
  It is recommended to use TLS for secure email delivery.
  :::
- (Optional) To use StartTLS, select either **Login** or **Plain** from the **Use STARTTLS** drop-down menu.  
  - **Login:** Credentials are sent as a base64-encoded string.
  - **Plain:** Credentials are sent in plain text.

:::warning
With StartTLS, credentials are transmitted in plain text before encryption is established.
:::

## Enabling Email Notifications for Policies

1. In the Alauda Container Security portal, go to **Platform Configuration** > **Policy Management**.
2. Select one or more policies to enable notifications for.
3. Under **Bulk actions**, select **Enable notification**.
4. In the **Enable notification** window, choose the **Email** notifier.
5. Click **Enable**.

:::info

- Notifications are opt-in. Assign a notifier to each policy to receive alerts.
- Notifications are sent only once per alert. A new alert is generated for:
    - The first policy violation in a deployment.
    - A runtime-phase policy violation after the previous alert is resolved.

By following these steps, you can ensure that Alauda Container Security notifies the right people about important security events in your container platform.
