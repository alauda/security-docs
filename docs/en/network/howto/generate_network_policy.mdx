# Generating Network Policies with Alauda Container Security

Alauda Container Security enables you to automatically generate Kubernetes network policies based on observed network flows, helping you secure pod communication and reduce your attack surface.

## Overview

Kubernetes network policies define which pods can receive or send network traffic. Manually creating these YAML files can be complex. Alauda Container Security simplifies this by generating policies according to the following principles:

- **One Policy per Deployment:** Alauda Container Security generates a network policy for each deployment in the selected namespace, using the deployment's pod selector.
  - If a deployment already has a network policy, Alauda Container Security will not overwrite or delete it.
  - New deployments are unrestricted until you generate or create new policies for them.
  - If a new deployment needs to access a protected deployment, you may need to update the policy.

- **Naming Convention:** Each policy is named `stackrox-generated-<deployment-name>` and includes an identifying label.

- **Allowing External Traffic:** Alauda Container Security generates a rule allowing traffic from any IP if:
  - The deployment receives connections from outside the cluster during the selected period, or
  - The deployment is exposed via a node port or load balancer service.

- **Ingress Rules:** For each observed incoming connection:
  - If from the same namespace, Alauda Container Security uses the source deployment's pod selector.
  - If from a different namespace, Alauda Container Security uses a namespace selector and automatically labels namespaces as needed.

> **Note:** If a standalone pod lacks labels, the generated policy may allow traffic from/to the entire namespace.

## How to Generate Network Policies

You can generate policies for clusters, namespaces, or specific deployments using the Alauda Container Security Network Graph.

To generate network policies, follow these steps:

1. In the Alauda Container Security portal, go to **Network Graph**.
2. Select a cluster and one or more namespaces.
3. (Optional) Select specific deployments or use **Filter deployments** to narrow the scope.
4. Click **Network Policy Generator** in the header.
5. (Optional) In the info panel, select **Exclude ports & protocols** to remove port/protocol restrictions.
6. Click **Generate and simulate network policies**. The selected scope is shown at the top of the panel.
7. (Optional) Copy or download the generated YAML file.
8. (Optional) Click **Compare** to view existing and generated policies side by side.
9. (Optional) Use the **Actions** menu to:
   - Share the YAML file with notifiers (e.g., Slack, ServiceNow, webhooks).
   - Rebuild rules from active traffic.
   - Revert to previously applied YAML.

> **Note:** Some namespaces (e.g., with existing ingress policies or protected namespaces) may not have generated policies.

## Downloading and Applying Policies

After generating policies, you can download and apply them to your cluster using the CLI or automated tools.

**To apply policies:**

```bash
$ kubectl create -f "<generated_file>.yml"
```

**To remove policies:**

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f "<generated_file>.yml"
```

> **Warning:** Always test network policies in a development or test environment before applying to production, as they may disrupt running applications.

## Reverting and Deleting Policies

- To revert to a previous policy, use the **Revert rules to previously applied YAML** option in the Alauda Container Security portal.
- To delete all automatically generated policies:

```bash
$ kubectl get ns -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | \
xargs -n 1 kubectl delete networkpolicies -l \
'network-policy-generator.stackrox.io/generated=true' -n
```

## Additional Notes

- The Network Graph does not visualize generated policies.
- Only ingress traffic is restricted by generated policies; egress policies are not generated.
