# Network Baseline Management in the Network Graph

Alauda Container Security  helps you minimize network risks by using network baselining. This proactive approach secures your infrastructure by learning normal network flows and identifying any deviations as anomalies.

## How Network Baselining Works

When you first install Alauda Container Security , there is no default network baseline. As Alauda Container Security  observes network activity, it automatically adds discovered network flows to the baseline:

- New network flows are added to the baseline during the observation phase.
- These flows are considered normal and do not trigger any alerts or violations.

After the observation phase:

- Alauda Container Security  stops adding new flows to the baseline.
- Any new network flow not in the baseline is marked as anomalous, but does not trigger violations by default.

## Viewing and Managing Network Baselines

You can view and manage network baselines in the network graph interface.

### Steps to View Baselines

1. Click the **Namespaces** dropdown and search or select namespaces.
2. Click the **Deployments** dropdown and search or select deployments to display in the network graph.
3. In the network graph, click a deployment to open its information panel.
4. Go to the **Baseline** tab. Use the **filter by entity name** field to narrow down displayed flows.

### Marking Baseline Flows as Anomalous

- To mark a single flow as anomalous, select the entity, click the overflow menu, and choose **Mark as anomalous**.
- To mark multiple flows, select them, click **Bulk actions**, and choose **Mark as anomalous**.

### Additional Options

- **Exclude ports and protocols**: Check the box to ignore port and protocol information in the baseline.
- **Download as network policy**: Click **Download baseline as network policy** to export the baseline as a YAML file.

## Downloading Network Baselines

You can export network baselines as YAML files for further use.

**Steps:**

1. In the Alauda Container Security  portal, go to **Network Graph**.
2. Select the desired namespaces and deployments.
3. In the deployment's information panel, open the **Baseline** tab.
4. (Optional) Filter flows or exclude ports/protocols.
5. Click **Download baseline as network policy**.

## Configuring Baseline Observation Period

You can adjust how long Alauda Container Security  observes network flows before finalizing the baseline using environment variables.

### Setting Environment Variables

Set the following variables in your deployment:

```bash
kubectl -n stackrox set env deploy/central ROX_NETWORK_BASELINE_OBSERVATION_PERIOD=<value>
kubectl -n stackrox set env deploy/central ROX_BASELINE_GENERATION_DURATION=<value>
```

- `<value>` must be a valid time unit, e.g., `300ms`, `2h45m`, `-1.5h`.
- Supported units: `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.

## Enabling Alerts for Anomalous Network Flows

Alauda Container Security  can be configured to trigger violations for anomalous network flows (flows not in the baseline).

**Steps:**

1. In the network graph, select the desired namespace and deployment.
2. Open the **Baseline** tab in the deployment's information panel.
3. Toggle the **Alert on baseline violations** option.

- When enabled, anomalous flows will trigger violations.
- Toggle off to stop receiving such alerts.
