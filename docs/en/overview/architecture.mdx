# Architecture

## System Architecture

### Abstract

This document provides a concise overview of the Alauda Container Security architecture for Kubernetes environments.

---

Alauda Container Security adopts a distributed, container-based architecture for scalable, low-impact security on Alauda Container Platform or Kubernetes clusters.

### Key Components

- **Central Services**: Deployed on a single cluster, providing management, API, and UI (Alauda Container Security Portal). Includes Central, Central DB (PostgreSQL 13), and the Scanner V4 vulnerability scanner.
- **Secured Cluster Services**: Deployed on each protected cluster. Includes Sensor (cluster monitoring and policy enforcement), Admission Controller (policy admission), Collector (runtime and network data collection), and optional scanner components.

### Scanner Overview

- **Scanner V4**: The default and only supported scanner since version 4.7. Supports language and OS-specific image scanning. Consists of Indexer, Matcher, and DB.

### Vulnerability Sources

- Scanner V4: Red Hat VEX, Red Hat CVE Map, OSV, NVD, and additional OS sources.

### Deployment Notes

- Operator installs a lightweight Scanner V4 on each cluster for integrated registry scanning.
- Helm installs require `scannerV4.disable=false` to enable the lightweight Scanner V4.
- If Central and secured cluster services share a namespace, only Central deploys Scanner V4 components.

### External Integrations

- Third-party systems (CI/CD, SIEM, logging, email)
- roxctl CLI
- Image registries (auto/manual integration)
- definitions.stackrox.io (vulnerability feeds)
- collector-modules.stackrox.io (kernel modules)
