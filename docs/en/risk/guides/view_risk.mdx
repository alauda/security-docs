# Evaluating Security Risks

Alauda Container Security assesses and ranks your deployments by security risk, highlighting vulnerabilities, configurations, and runtime activities needing attention.

## Risk View

The **Risk** view lists all deployments, sorted by a multi-factor risk metric (policy violations, image contents, configuration, etc.). Deployments at the top are the most at risk.

Each deployment shows:
- **Name**
- **Created**
- **Cluster**
- **Namespace**
- **Priority**

**Features:**
- Sort and filter violations
- Create new policies from filtered results

To see more details, select a deployment.

### Creating Policies from Risk View

You can create security policies based on your filters in the **Risk** view.

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Risk** in the portal.
2. Apply filters.
3. Click **New Policy** and fill required fields.

**Note:** Only Cluster, Namespace, Deployment, and Label filters are converted to policy scopes. Other filters may be dropped or modified.

**Scope Conversion Example:**
Filtering by `Cluster:A,B` and `Namespace:Z` creates:
- (Cluster=A AND Namespace=Z)
- (Cluster=B AND Namespace=Z)

## Risk Details Panel

Selecting a deployment opens the **Risk Details** panel with multiple tabs.

### Risk Indicators Tab

Shows:
- **Policy Violations**
- **Suspicious Process Executions**
- **Image Vulnerabilities**
- **Service Configurations**
- **Service Reachability**
- **Components Useful for Attackers**
- **Number of Components in Image**
- **Image Freshness**
- **RBAC Configuration**

*Only relevant sections are shown for the selected deployment.*

### Deployment Details Tab

Provides:
- Deployment ID
- Namespace
- Updated (timestamp)
- Deployment Type
- Replicas
- Labels
- Cluster name
- Annotations
- Service Account

**Container Configuration:**
- Image Name
- Resources: CPU/Memory requests and limits
- Mounts: Name, Source, Destination, Type
- Secrets: Kubernetes secrets and X.509 certificate details

**Security Context:**
- Privileged: `true` if privileged

### Process Discovery Tab

Lists all binaries executed in each container, summarized by deployment:
- **Binary Name**
- **Container**
- **Arguments**
- **Time** (most recent)
- **Pod ID**
- **UID**

Use `Process Name:<name>` in the filter bar to search.

### Event Timeline

The **Event Timeline** shows events for the selected deployment:
- Process activities
- Policy violations
- Container restarts/terminations

Events appear as icons on a timeline. Hover for details. You can:
- Show legend for event types
- Export as PDF/CSV
- Filter event types
- Expand to see events per container

A minimap controls the visible range.

**Notes:**
- On container restarts, up to 10 inactive instances per container are shown; process activities for previous instances are not tracked.
- Only the most recent execution of each (process name, arguments, UID) per pod is shown.
- Events are shown only for active pods.
- Timestamps are adjusted for accuracy.
