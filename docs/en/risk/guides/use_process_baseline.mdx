# Using Process Baseline

Process baselining in Alauda Container Security helps secure your infrastructure by learning which processes normally run in your containers and enforcing that only these are allowed.

## What is a Process Baseline?

When you deploy Alauda Container Security, there is no default process baseline. As deployments are discovered, a process baseline is automatically created for each container type, including all observed processes.

## Baseline States

### Unlocked
- During initial discovery (first hour), baselines are unlocked.
- New processes are automatically added to the baseline and do not trigger risks or violations.
- After one hour, new processes are marked as risks but do not trigger violations, and are not added to the baseline.

### Locked
- Locking a baseline stops new processes from being added.
- Any process not in the baseline triggers a violation.
- You can always manually add or remove processes from the baseline.

If a deployment has multiple container types, each has its own baseline. If some are locked and others unlocked, the deployment status shows as **Mixed**.

## Managing Process Baselines

You can view and manage process baselines in the **Risk** view of the Alauda Container Security portal.

### Viewing Baselines
1. Go to **Risk** in the portal.
2. Select a deployment.
3. In the details panel, open the **Process Discovery** tab.
4. Baselines are listed under **Spec Container Baselines**.

### Adding a Process
1. In **Process Discovery**, under **Running Processes**, click the **Add** icon next to a process not already in the baseline.

### Removing a Process
1. In **Process Discovery**, under **Spec Container Baselines**, click the **Remove** icon next to the process you want to remove.

### Locking/Unlocking the Baseline
- Click the **Lock** icon to enforce violations for unlisted processes.
- Click the **Unlock** icon to stop enforcing violations.

By managing process baselines, you ensure only approved processes run in your environment, reducing security risks.
