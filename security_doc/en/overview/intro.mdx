1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or a functional module, providing an overall description of the product or function. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and intended use, offering readers a clear initial understanding.

Typically, the introduction, advantages, and feature overview are combined into a single document based on the overall length of the content. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these into separate documents; for a single functional module, they can be combined into one document.

2. Importance of an Introduction

A product or functional module may involve many aspects, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Ensure Unified Understanding: Serve as an opening to provide a consistent understanding, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Offer readers a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repeatedly explaining basic product knowledge.

3. How to Write the Introduction Section

- Be Concise: Summarize the core points of the product in concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target readers and provide information they care about.

4. Special Features of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the value of product features, enabling users to quickly understand and use them.

Differences between product-level and module-level introductions:

Product-Level Introduction Characteristics

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantage in the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The product's applicable scenarios are more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Module-Level Introduction Characteristics

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by a single module.

# Introduction

## [Product/Module] Introduction

> Apart from the introduction itself, if other sections are too long or relatively complex, they can be separated into independent documents.

This section provides a brief description. Specifically introduce the intended use of [Product/Module Name]. For example:

Container Management is a containerized management module built on Kubernetes for cloud-native applications. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the enterprise's cloud application process and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. Through container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
