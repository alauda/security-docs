:::tip

If the parent module requires a separate manual upgrade process, you should provide upgrade documentation. Otherwise, this section can be omitted.

Upgrade documentation should include the upgrade process, configuration options, and rollback procedures.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade process between versions, consider organizing the upgrade documentation into a directory with separate documents for each version (e.g., "Upgrade from 3.10", "Upgrade from 3.18").

You can view an [Upgrade example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for reference.
